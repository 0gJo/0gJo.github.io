# Maid

Maid is an unassuming [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) theme that places content first by tucking away navigation in a hidden drawer. It's based on [Poole](http://getpoole.com) and [Lanyon](http://lanyon.getpoole.com) built by [mdo](https://github.com/mdo).

## Usage

Maid is a theme built on top of [Poole](https://github.com/poole/poole), which provides a fully furnished Jekyll setupâ€”just download and start the Jekyll server. See [the Poole usage guidelines](https://github.com/poole/poole#usage) for how to install and use Jekyll.


## Options

Maid includes some customizable options, typically applied via classes on the `<body>` element.

### Pagination

It's automagic.

### Sidebar menu

Create a list of nav links in the sidebar by assigning each Jekyll page the correct layout in the page's [front-matter](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/frontmatter/).

```

layout: page
title: About

```

**Why require a specific layout?** Jekyll will return *all* pages, including the `atom.xml`, and with an alphabetical sort order. To ensure the first link is *Home*, we exclude the `index.html` page from this list by specifying the `page` layout.

### Related posts

As close as you can get with Jekyll.
